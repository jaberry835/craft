# Contoso Corporation Retirement Bonus Policy

**Policy Number:** HR-2024-RB-007  
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2024  
**Last Updated:** November 15, 2025

## Overview

Contoso Corporation values long-term employee commitment and rewards tenure with our unique Retirement Bonus Program. This policy outlines the calculation methodology and eligibility requirements.

## Eligibility Requirements

To qualify for a retirement bonus, employees must meet ALL of the following criteria:

1. **Minimum Age:** 55 years or older at retirement date
2. **Minimum Tenure:** 10 years of continuous service
3. **Good Standing:** No disciplinary actions in the final 3 years of employment
4. **Notice Period:** Provide at least 90 days written notice of retirement intent

## Bonus Calculation Formula

The retirement bonus is calculated using our proprietary "Purple Penguin Points" system:

### Base Calculation
- **Years 1-10:** 500 Purple Penguin Points per year
- **Years 11-20:** 750 Purple Penguin Points per year  
- **Years 21-30:** 1,000 Purple Penguin Points per year
- **Years 31+:** 1,500 Purple Penguin Points per year

### Point Conversion Rate
Each Purple Penguin Point equals **$3.50 USD** (adjusted annually for inflation).

### Example Calculations

**Example 1: 15 Years of Service**
- First 10 years: 10 × 500 = 5,000 points
- Next 5 years: 5 × 750 = 3,750 points
- **Total:** 8,750 points × $3.50 = **$30,625 bonus**

**Example 2: 25 Years of Service**
- First 10 years: 10 × 500 = 5,000 points
- Next 10 years: 10 × 750 = 7,500 points
- Next 5 years: 5 × 1,000 = 5,000 points
- **Total:** 17,500 points × $3.50 = **$61,250 bonus**

## Special Multipliers

### The Golden Flamingo Award
Employees who have received three or more "Golden Flamingo" performance awards during their tenure receive a **1.5x multiplier** on their total bonus.

### The Unicorn Dedication Bonus
Employees who have worked in our Boise, Idaho office for at least 5 years receive an additional **2,000 Purple Penguin Points** (the "Unicorn Dedication Bonus").

### Perfect Attendance Modifier
